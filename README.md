- numpy
- pandas
- folium
- matplotlib

*Instructions:*

In order to run the presentation webpage have all of the above packages installed in your python IDE or environment and run app.py. It will call all of the necessary scripts that we have written to create the visualizations.

To browse the webpage go to localhost:5000 in your web browser.

The only things that will be excluded from running via app.py are the unit testing code (which can be found in the repo titled: dataprocessing_test.py) and the multilabel classifier.

You can run the test file to check that the test cases are functional.
